# hass-utility_meter_alternative
an alternate approach to the official hass.io utility_meter

This code originally comes from 
https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant

The standard component is great, howver it did not suit my needs, and the devs did not think there was a need for change/enhancement.

I have put this up for those who would also need this approach.

So how is it different?
